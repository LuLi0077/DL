# Generate Faces

Use a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate novel faces


## Autoencoders

Build a simple autoencoder to compress the MNIST dataset. With autoencoders, we pass input data through an encoder that makes a compressed representation of the input. Then, this representation is passed through a decoder to reconstruct the input data. Generally the encoder and decoder will be built with neural networks, then trained on example data.
