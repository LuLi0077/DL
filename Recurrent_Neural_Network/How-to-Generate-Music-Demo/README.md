# How-to-Generate-Music-Demo

This is the code for 'How to Generate Music - Intro to Deep Learning #9' by Siraj Raval on YouTube. It uses Keras & Theano, two deep learning libraries, to generate jazz music. Specifically, it builds a two-layer LSTM, learning from the given MIDI file. 

### Dependencies

* [Keras](http://keras.io/#installation)
* [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install.html#bleeding-edge-install-instructions) ("bleeding-edge" version on GitHub)
* [music21](http://web.mit.edu/music21/doc/installing/index.html)

### Usage

Run on CPU with command:  
```
python generator.py [# of epochs]
```

Run on GPU with command:  
```
THEANO_FLAGS=mode=FAST_RUN,device=gpu,floatX=float32 python generator.py [# of epochs]
```
Note: running Keras/Theano on GPU is formally supported for only NVIDIA cards (CUDA backend).

Note: `preprocess.py` must be modified to work with other MIDI files (the relevant "melody" MIDI part needs to be selected).
